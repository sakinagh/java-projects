1 Description
This program implements a bounded stack interface. Bounded stack is a stack with pre-defined
capacity. This implements the interface in two ways — array and list.


2 Class Design
• BDDStack.java   Interface includes primary and secondary methods.

• AbstractStack.java   This is an abstract class. The class “implements” BDDStack interface.
Implements only the secondary methods defined in BDDStack interface.

• ArrayStack.java   This is a concrete class. The class “extends” AbstractStack class. Uses
an array to implement only the primary methods defined in BDDStack interface. In
addition, the class satisfies the Iterable interface, and the traversal starts from the
bottom of the stack to the top. It is needed to create a nested class that “implements”
Iterator interface.

• ListStack.java   This is the other concrete class. The class also “extends” AbstractStack
class. Uses a Java built-in ArrayList to implement only the primary methods
defined in BDDStack interface. In addition, the class satisfies Iterable interface, and the
traversal should start from the bottom of the stack to the top. There is no need for 
nested classes.
