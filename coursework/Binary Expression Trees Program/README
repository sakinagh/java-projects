Input
The program will read expressions (Strings) from standard input. There will be one expression
per line. Each line will have a special character designating the type of the expression. This special
character will be the first character of the input line.
1. ‘!’ denotes a prefix expression. Example: ! + - a * b c / d e
2. ‘@’ denotes a postfix expression. Example: @ a b c * - d e / +

Output
For each input expression, immediately output the following:
1. Prefix expression if the input is in postfix notation OR postfix expression if the input is in
prefix notation. 
2. Graphical binary tree. Both example expressions in the Input section should show
     +
  -     /
a   *  d  e
   b c
