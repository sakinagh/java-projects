1 Background
The program will manage polynomials in three variables (x, y, and z) with non-zero integer
coefficients, and non-negative integer exponents. Three variable polynomials are of the
following form:

p(x, y, z) = c1(x^A1)(y^B1)(z^C1) + ... + cn(x^An)(y^Bn)(z^Cn)

where ci is the coefficient, and Ai, Bi, and Ci represent the exponents of variables.

To simplify the project, we only deal with polynomials in the above form, under the following
assumptions.
1. We assume that every term in a polynomial follows the xyz sequence. We only deal with a term
like (5x^6)(y^3)(z^2), and we won’t deal with a term like (5y^3)(x^6)(z^2).

2. We assume that a coefficient can only occur at the beginning of a term. We only deal with a
term like (6x^8)(y^4)(z^5). We won’t deal with a term like 3x^8 · (2y^4)(z^5).

3. We assume that no term in a polynomial contains a division operator. We won’t deal with a
term like 4x^3/((y^7)(z^5)).


2 Requirements
  2.1 Input Representation of Polynomials
The purpose of the program is to interact with users by inserting, deleting, and searching named
polynomials. By following the assumptions defined in Section 1, we can simplify how a polynomial
can be input into the program. In a polynomial, each term is represented by four integers separated
by commas:
• coefficient
• exponent for variable x
• exponent for variable y
• exponent for variable z
and multiple terms are separated by space characters. For example, if the polynomial is

A = (6x^9)(y^6)(z^3) + (5x^4)(z^5) − 3

its input should be

A 6,9,6,3 5,4,0,5 -3,0,0,0

  2.2 Output Representation of Polynomials
The program output of polynomials is similar to the standard mathematical form with simplifications.
For example, if the polynomial is

B = −2x^3(y^7)(z^2) + (x^4)(z^5) − 8y^3(z) + 9

its output should be

B = - 2(x^3)(y^7)(z^2) + (x^4)(z^5) - 8(y^3)(z) + 9

To ensure correct output formats, please attend to the following items.
    1. Pay attention to the usage of parentheses in the above example.
    2. Pay attention to the spaces around operators in the above example.
    3. If the coefficient of the first term is positive, do not display the plus sign for the first term.
For example, B = 2(x^3)(y^7)(z^2) + (x^4)(z^5) - 8(y^3)(z) + 9
    4. If the coefficient of a term is 1, do not display the coefficient. The exception is that if the
exponents of x, y, and z are all 0, and the coefficient is 1, 1 must be displayed for this term.
For example, B = - 2(x^3)(y^7)(z^2) + (x^4)(z^5) - 8(y^3)(z) + 1
    5. If the coefficient of a term is −1, only display the negative sign for the coefficient. The
exception is that if the exponents of x, y, and z are all 0, and the coefficient is −1, −1 must
be displayed for this term. For example,
B = - 2(x^3)(y^7)(z^2) - (x^4)(z^5) - 8(y^3)(z) - 1
    6. If the exponent of a variable is 0, do not display this variable.
    7. If the exponent of a variable is 1, just display the variable itself, and keep the parentheses.

  2.3 Polynomial Management Operations
The program maintains a list of named polynomials. The management operations are as
follows.

INSERT Insert a new polynomial into the list. If the insert operation is successful, output the
polynomial. The insert operation can fail if there is already a polynomial in the list with
the same name. In the case of an insertion failure, display the message POLYNOMIAL <name>
ALREADY INSERTED.

DELETE Delete an existing named polynomial from the list. If the delete operation is successful,
display the message POLYNOMIAL <name> SUCCESSFULLY DELETED. If the named polynomial
does not exist, display the message POLYNOMIAL <name> DOES NOT EXIST.

SEARCH Search for a named polynomial in the list. If it is found in the list, output the polynomial. 
If the polynomial does not exist, display the message POLYNOMIAL <name> DOES NOT EXIST.

QUIT This command makes the program properly exit. The QUIT command should remove all
the polynomials from the list, and then exit the program.

To review, the following examples are provided.
INSERT A 3,2,0,0 5,1,1,0 -8,0,2,0 4,1,0,0 -3,0,1,0 12,0,0,0
A = 3(x^2) + 5(x)(y) - 8(y^2) + 4(x) - 3(y) + 12
INSERT B 1,3,0,0 6,0,2,0 -15,1,0,0 11,0,0,0
B = (x^3) + 6(y^2) - 15(x) + 11
INSERT A 2,1,0,0 3,0,1,0 -5,0,0,0
POLYNOMIAL A ALREADY INSERTED
DELETE B
POLYNOMIAL B SUCCESSFULLY DELETED
DELETE C
POLYNOMIAL C DOES NOT EXIST
SEARCH A
A = 3(x^2) + 5(x)(y) - 8(y^2) + 4(x) - 3(y) + 12
SEARCH B
POLYNOMIAL B DOES NOT EXIST
