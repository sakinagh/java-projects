 ~Introduction~
This contains a simple chat application implemented in Java. The application consists of a server and a client, 
both equipped with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The chat allows users to send messages to each other through the server.



 ~Features~
The application consists of two main components:

Server
	ControlServer: 
		Manages the server-side GUI and handles incoming client connections. Displays the current date and 
		time along with messages received from clients.

	ServerThread: 
		Represents a thread for handling communication with a client. Manages the input and output streams, 
		reads and processes messages, and either broadcasts them to all clients or sends them to specific recipients.

Client
	View: 
		Represents the client-side GUI. Provides components for sending messages, configuring the chat, and 
		displaying incoming messages.

	ModelClient: 
		Connects to the server, reads input from the user, and sends messages to the server. Utilizes a 
		separate thread for continuous message reception.

	ClientRunnable: 
		Implements the Runnable interface for a separate thread that continuously reads messages from the server.



 ~Instructions~

1. Server Setup:
	Run the Lab5Server package to start the server GUI.
	The server listens on port 5000 for incoming client connections.

2. Client Setup:
	Run the Lab5Client package to start the client GUI.
	Enter your name, message, and recipient (if applicable), and click "Send" to send messages to the server.

3. Communication:
	Clients can send messages to each other through the server.
	Messages are displayed in the server GUI, and clients receive messages in their GUIs.

4. Encryption (Optional): 
	The client GUI includes an option to encrypt messages using a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of 1.
	Check the "Encrypt" checkbox before sending a message to apply encryption.
